Huh You Think Here Is Eclipse Loadsting?

Nope

Here I Found A Way How To Get Auth Link And Using Just A Java Script I Can See Source.

Here Some Hints;)

#Main Version
\?\107e\121\61 =  "?key=" + getgenv().mainkey = ?key=nil

#Lite Version

Auth Link+ type=2 = Full Auth Link Of Lite Version

The Links Are Pretty Easy To Decrypt

(I Hope I Didnt Gettin Blacklisted🙏)
